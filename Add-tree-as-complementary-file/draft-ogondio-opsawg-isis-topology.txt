1.  Introduction

   Network operators perform the capacity planning for their networks
   and run regular what-if scenarios analysis based on representations
   of the real network.  Those what-if analysis and capacity planning
   processes require, among other information, a topological view
   (domains, nodes, links, network interconnection) of the deployed
   network.

   This document defines a YANG data model representing an abstracted
   view of a network topology containing Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System (IS-IS).  It covers the topology of IP/MPLS
   networks running IS-IS as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) protocol.
   The proposed YANG mode augments the "A YANG Data Model for Network
   Topologies" [RFC8345] and"A YANG Data Model for Layer 3 Topologies"
   [RFC8346] by adding IS-IS concepts.  This YANG data model is used to
   export the IS-IS related topology directly from a network controller
   to an Operation Support System (OSS) tools.

   Note that the YANG model is in this document strictly adheres to the
   concepts (and the YANG module) in "A YANG Data Model for Network
   Topologies" [RFC8345] and"A YANG Data Model for Layer 3 Topologies"
   [RFC8346].  While investigating the IS-IS topology, some limitations
   have discovered in [RFC8345], regarding how the digital map can be
   represented.  Those limitations (and potential improvements) are
   covered in [I-D.draft-havel-opsawg-digital-map].

   This document explains the scope and purpose of the IS-IS topology
   model and how the topology and service models fit together.  The YANG
   data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with IS-IS and the
   contents of [RFC8345].  The document uses terms from those documents.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950], [RFC8795] and [RFC8346].

   The term Digital Twin, Digital Map, Digital Map Modelling, Digital
   Map Model, Digital Map Data, and Topology are specified in
   [I-D.draft-havel-opsawg-digital-map].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Tree Diagram

   Authors include a simplified graphical representation of the data
   model is used in Section 5 of this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.4.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

              +========+=======================+===========+
              | Prefix | Yang Module           | Reference |
              +========+=======================+===========+

2.  Use Cases

   This information is required in the IP/MPLS planning process to
   properly assess the required network resources to meet the traffic
   demands in normal and failure scenarios.  Network operators perform
   the capacity planning for their networks and run regular what-if
   scenarios analysis based on representations of the real network.
   Those what-if analysis and capacity planning processes require, among
   other information, a topological view (domains, nodes, links, network
   interconnection) of the deployed network.

   The standardization of an abstracted view of the IS-IS topology model
   as NorthBound Interface (NBI) of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
   controllers allows the inject this information into third party tools
   covering specialized cases.

   The IS-IS topological model should export enough IS-IS information to
   permit these tools simulating the IP routing.  By adding the traffic
   demand, ideally at the IP flow level, we can simulate the traffic
   growth and its effect on the routing.  That is, simulating how IP-
   level traffic demands would be forwarded, after IS-IS convergence is
   reached, and from there estimating, using appropriate mathematical
   models, related KPIs like the occupation in the links or end-to-end
   latencies.

   In summary, the network-wide view of the IS-IS topology enables
   multiple use cases:

   *  Network design: verifying that the actual deployed IS-IS network
      conforms to the planned design

   *  Failure analysis.  Systematic and massive test of the network
      under multiple simulated failure situations, evaluating the
      network fault tolerance properties, and using mathematical models
      to derive statistical network availability metrics.

   *  What-if analysis.  Estimation of the network KPIs in modified
      network situations.  For instance, failure situations, traffic
      anomaly situations, addition or deletion of new adjacencies, IGP
      weight reconfigurations.

   *  Capacity planning.  Dimensioning or redesign of the IP
      infrastructure to satisfy target KPI metrics under existing or
      forecasted traffic demands.

2.1.  Relationship with the IS-IS YANG Model

   [RFC9130] specifies a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage the IS-IS protocol on network elements.  This data model
   covers the configuration of an IS-IS routing protocol instance, as
   well as the retrieval of IS-IS operational states.  [RFC9130] is
   still expected to be used for individual network elements
   configuration and monitoring.  On the other hand, the proposed YANG
   model in this document covers the abstracted view of the entire
   network topology containing IS-IS.  As such, this model is available
   via the NBI of SDN controllers.

2.2.  Relationship with Digital Map

   As described in [I-D.draft-havel-opsawg-digital-map], the Digital Map
   provides the core multi-layer topology model and data for the digital
   twin and connects them to the other digital twin models and data.

   The Digital Map Modelling defines the core topological entities,
   their role in the network, core properties, and relationships both
   inside each layer and between the layers.

   The Digital Map Model is a basic topological model that is linked to
   other functional parts of the digital twin and connects them all:
   configuration, maintenance, assurance (KPIs, status, health,
   symptoms), Traffic Engineering (TE), different behaviors and actions,
   simulation, emulation, mathematical abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.

   As such the IGP topology of the Digital Map (in this case, IS-IS) is
   just one of the layers of the Digital Map, for specific user (the
   network operator in charge of the IGP) for specific IGP use cases as
   described before.

3.  Use of IETF-Topology for Representing an IP/MPLS network domain

   IP/MPLS Networks can contain multiple domain IGP domains.  We can
   define an IGP domain as the collection of nodes and links that
   participate in the same IGP process.  The topology information of a
   domain can be structured according to ietf-network-topology data
   model [RFC8345].  For example, if BGP-LS is used to collect the
   information, the nodes and links that are announced with the same
   combination of AS number / domain ID are considered to belong to the
   same domain.

   If a node and/or layer termination point participates in more than
   one IGP it will be present in multiple IGP domain networks.

   The ietf-network instance MUST include the following properties to
   indicate it is a domain running an IGP instance:

   A network-id that uniquely identifies such domain in the network.
   The "network-types" property should include the l3t:l3-unicast-
   topology, to indicate it is a network in which the nodes are capable
   of forwarding unicast packet.  Also, this draft proposed to add a new
   property, "isis-topology", to indicate the topology being represented
   is running the IS-IS IGP process.

   Also, should the topology include information such as bandwidth,
   delay information or color, it must include tet:te-topology.  To
   include delay and bandwdith performance measurements , MUST include
   tet-pkt:te-packet under the previous property The supporting-network
   property can include the network-id of a base layer-3 network.  The
   node property should include the list of nodes as described below.
   The ietf-network-topology:link MUST be present, with one link per
   each IP adjacency (one link for each direction of the adjancency).

4.  YANG Data Model for IS-IS Topology

   The abstract (base) network data model is defined in the "ietf-
   network" and "ietf-network-topology" modules of [RFC8345].  The L3
   topology module is defined in the "ietf-l3-unicast-topology" module
   of [RFC8346].  The ietf-l3-isis-topology builds on the data models
   defined in [RFC8345] and [RFC8346], augmenting the nodes with IS-IS
   information.

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at
   the node level.  Each parameter and description are detailed
   following:

   *  Network-types: Its presence identifies the IS-IS topology type.
      Thus, the network type MUST be isis-topology.

   *  IS-IS timer attributes: Identifies the node timer attributes
      configured in the network element.  They are LSP lifetime and the
      LSP refresh interval.

   *  IS-IS status: contains the IS-IS status attributes (level, area-
      address and neighbours).

   The following figure is based on the Figure 1 from [RFC8346], where
   the example-ospf-topology is replaced with ietf-l3-isis-topology and
   where arrows show how the modules augment each other.

   There are some limitations in the [RFC8345] that are explained in
   more detail in [I-D.draft-havel-opsawg-digital-map].  The current
   version of the ietf-l3-isis-topology module is based on the current
   version of [RFC8345].  The following will be addressed when [RFC8345]
   is extended to support the identified limitations:

   *  Both IS-IS domain and IS-IS areas could be modelled as networks

   *  The IS-IS Areas will be connected via IS-IS links

   *  IS-IS nodes could belong to multiple IS-IS networks

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at
   the network level.

   *  Network-types: Its presence identifies the IS-IS topology type.
      Thus, the network type MUST be isis-topology.

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at
   the node level.  Each parameter and description are detailed
   following:

   *  IS-IS node core attributes: contains the IS-IS core attributes
      (system-id, level, area-address).

   *  IS-IS timer attributes: Identifies the node timer attributes
      configured in the network element.  They are LSP lifetime and the
      LSP refresh interval.

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at
   the link level.  Each parameter and description are detailed
   following:

   *  IS-IS link level.  The level must be the same as the termination
      points at each end for Level 1 and Level 2 interfaces.  There may
      be 2 links between the Level1-2 IS-IS interfaces, one for Level 1
      adjacency and one for Level 2 adjacency.

   *  IS-IS link metric.  Added on top of metric1 and metric2 of the l3-
      link-attributes

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations are included at the
   termination point level.  Each parameter is listed as follows:

   *  Interface-type: point-to point or braodcast

   *  Level.  The level must be the same as for the node, except when
      node is Level 1-2 and the interfaces can only be Level 1 or Level
      2.

   *  Passive mode

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF {!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-isis-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   name:         ietf-l3-isis-topology
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-isis-topology
   maintained by IANA: N
   prefix:       ietf-l3-isis-topology
   reference:    RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  Implementation Status

   Note to the RFC-Editor: Please remove this section before publishing.

A.1.  Implementation Status in Telefonica Group

   The Yang based topology model proposed in this draft is being used
   today in one of the Telefonica operations to export the Multi-vendor
   IP/MPLS topology based on multiple IS-IS domains to several Operation
   Support System tools for visualization, capacity planning and
   simulation.  A commercial controller has implemented the exposure of
   the information.  It is one of the building blocks to expose the
   network capabilities, together with other models which cover the
   inventory and service provisioning in a vendor-agnostic fashion.

A.2.  Huawei Digital Map PoC Status

   As mentioned in [I-D.draft-havel-opsawg-digital-map], a Digital Map
   PoC with a real lab has been built, based on multi- vendor devices,
   with [RFC8345] as the base YANG module for the topology building
   blocks.  This PoC successfully modelled IS-IS routing (among other
   technologies and layers), but it needs to be further aligned with
   this latest developments in this draft.

A.3.  Implementation Status in E-lighthouse Network Solutions

   E-lighthouse Network Solutions (https://e-lighthouse.com/)
   implementation is consuming the IS-IS network topology information
   exported by a commercial controller, using the Yang model proposed in
   this draft.  It is able to simulate the network behavior under
   different changes, covering the what-if, failure analysis,
   dimensioning and other use cases mentioned in this draft.
