      A YANG Data Model for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Topology
                 draft-ogondio-nmop-bgp-topology-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for representing an
   abstracted view of a network topology that contains Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) information.  This document augments the 'ietf-
   network' data model by adding BGP concepts.  The aim of the model is
   to, from a SDN controller perspective, obtain iBGP and MP-BGP
   topology information from the network and to export it towards NBI
   interface to the service orchestration layer.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   Network operators perform the capacity planning for their networks
   and run regular what-if scenarios analysis based on representations
   of the real network.  Those what-if analysis and capacity planning
   processes require, among other information, a topological view
   (domains, nodes, links, network interconnection) of the deployed
   network.

   This document defines a YANG data model representing an abstracted
   view of a network topology containing Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   with the following assumption: * Areas can be explicit, depending on
   which IGP protocol is used. + Metrics can be provided to the
   operations team for greater control of the network. - A view of the
   topology of the network built on the basis of the neighbors can be
   presented.

   This YANG data model can be used to export the BGP related topology
   directly from a network controller to Operation Support System (OSS)
   tools or to a higher level controller.

   This document defines a YANG data model for representing, managing
   and controlling the BGP topology.  The data model augments ietf-
   network module [RFC8345] by adding the BGP information.

   This document explains the scope and purpose of the BGP topology
   model and how the topology and service models fit together.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with BGP and the
   contents of [RFC8345].  The document uses terms from those documents.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950], [RFC8795] and [RFC8346].

   The term Digital Twin, Digital Map, Digital Map Modelling, Digital
   Map Model, Digital Map Data, and Topology are specified in
   [I-D.draft-havel-nmop-digital-map].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Tree Diagram

   Authors include a simplified graphical representation of the data
   model specified in Section 4 of this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.4.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

               +========+======================+===========+
               | Prefix | Yang Module          | Reference |
               +========+======================+===========+
               | bgpnt  | ietf-l3-bgp-topology | RFCXXX    |
               +--------+----------------------+-----------+

2.  Use Cases

   Use cases for this document are the same than explained in
   [I-D.draft-ogondio-nmop-isis-topology].  Here are included for
   completeness and discussion.  Future versions may consider removing
   them.

   This information is required in the IP/MPLS planning process to
   properly assess the required network resources to meet the traffic
   demands in normal and failure scenarios.  Network operators perform
   the capacity planning for their networks and run regular what-if
   scenarios analysis based on representations of the real network.
   Those what-if analysis and capacity planning processes require, among
   other information, a topological view (domains, nodes, links, network
   interconnection) of the deployed network.

   The standardization of an abstracted view of the BGP topology model
   as NorthBound Interface (NBI) of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
   controllers allows the unified query of the BGP topology in order to
   inject this information into third party tools covering specialized
   cases.

   The BGP topological model should export enough BGP information to
   permit these tools to simulate the IP routing.  By mapping the
   traffic demand, ideally at the IP flow level, to the topology, we can
   simulate the traffic growth, evaluating this way its effect on the
   routing and quality of service.  That is, simulating how IP-level
   traffic demands would be forwarded, after BGP convergence is reached,
   and from there estimating, using appropriate mathematical models,
   related KPIs like the occupation in the links or end-to-end
   latencies.

   In summary, the network-wide view of the BGP topology enables
   multiple use cases:

   *  Network design: verifying that the actual deployed BGP network
      conforms to the planned design.

   *  Capacity planning.  Dimensioning or redesign of the IP
      infrastructure to satisfy target KPI metrics under existing or
      forecasted traffic demands.

   *  What-if analysis.  Estimation of the network KPIs in modified
      network situations.  For instance, failure situations, traffic
      anomaly situations, addition or deletion of new adjacencies, IGP
      weight reconfigurations, etc.

   *  Failure analysis.  Systematic and massive test of the network
      under multiple simulated failure situations, evaluating the
      network fault tolerance properties, and using mathematical models
      to derive statistical network availability metrics.

2.1.  Relationship with the BGP YANG Model

   TBD

2.2.  Relationship with Digital Map

   As described in [I-D.draft-havel-nmop-digital-map], the Digital Map
   provides the core multi-layer topology model and data for the digital
   twin and connects them to the other digital twin models and data.

   The Digital Map Modelling defines the core topological entities,
   their role in the network, core properties, and relationships both
   inside each layer and between the layers.

   The Digital Map Model is a basic topological model that is linked to
   other functional parts of the digital twin and connects them all:
   configuration, maintenance, assurance (KPIs, status, health,
   symptoms), Traffic Engineering (TE), different behaviors and actions,
   simulation, emulation, mathematical abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.

   As such the BGP topology of the Digital Map is just one of the layers
   of the Digital Map, for specific user (the network operator in charge
   of the BGP) for the specific use cases as described before.

3.  Description of the YANG Data Model for BGP Topology

   The abstract (base) network data model is defined in the "ietf-
   network" module of [RFC8345].  The BGP-topology builds on the network
   data model defined in the "ietf-network" module [RFC8345], augmenting
   the nodes with BGP information, which anchor the links and are
   contained in nodes.

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at
   the node level.  Each parameter and description are detailed
   following:

   *  Network-types /restconf/data/ietf-network:networks/network/
      network-types: Its presence identifies the BGP topology type.
      Thus, the network type MUST be bgp-topology.

   *  Local-as /restconf/data/ietf-networks/network/node/l3t:l3-node-
      attributes/bgp:local-as: Identifies the Local-AS configured in the
      Network-Element.

   *  Neighbors /restconf/data/ietf-network:networks/network/node/
      l3t:l3-node-attributes/bgp:neighbours: list of Neighbors of the
      Node.  Each Neighbor has the same set of parameters to describe
      the BGP session.

   *  Neighbour neighbour is identified by the IP address.  Description
      for troubleshooting purposes.

   *  Peer-As attributes/bgp:neighbours/bgp:peer-as: Autonomous System
      of the peer.  In case of iBGP sessions the Local -As and Peer-As
      is the same.

   *  Address-Family: Address Families shared by the nodes in the
      session.  This is a leaf-list, because more than one AFI + SAFI
      address family can be shared.  The options are alligned to the
      ones available in the IETF-BGP-TYPES (ipv4-unicast, ipv6-unicast,
      ipv4-labeled-unicast, ...)

   The following figure is based on the Figure 1 from [RFC8346], where
   the example-bgp-topology is replaced with ietf-l3-bgp-topology and
   where arrows show how the modules augment each other.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF {!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-bgp-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   name:         ietf-l3-bgp-topology
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-bgp-topology
   maintained by IANA: N
   prefix:       ietf-l3-bgp-topology
   reference:    RFC XXXX
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

8.  Implementation Status

   This section will be used to track the status of the implementations
   of the model.  It is aimed at being removed if the document becomes
   RFC.
