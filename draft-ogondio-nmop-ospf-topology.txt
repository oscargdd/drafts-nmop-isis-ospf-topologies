1.  Introduction

   Network operators perform the capacity planning for their networks
   and run regular what-if scenarios analysis based on representations
   of the real network.  Those what-if analysis and capacity planning
   processes require, among other information, a topological view
   (domains, nodes, links, network interconnection) of the deployed
   network.

   This document defines a YANG data model representing an abstracted
   view of a network topology containing Open Shortest Path First
   (OSPF).  It covers the topology of IP/MPLS networks running OSPF as
   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) protocol.  The proposed YANG model
   augments the "A YANG Data Model for Network Topologies" [RFC8345] and
   "A YANG Data Model for Layer 3 Topologies" [RFC8346] by adding OSPF
   concepts.  It is worth to highlight that the Yang model can also be
   used together with [RFC8795] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-yang-l3-te-topo] when Traffic engineering
   characteristics are required in the topological view.

   This YANG data model can be used to export the OSPF related topology
   directly from a network controller to Operation Support System (OSS)
   tools or to a higher level controller.

   Note that the YANG model is in this document strictly adheres to the
   concepts (and the YANG module) in "A YANG Data Model for Network
   Topologies" [RFC8345] and "A YANG Data Model for Layer 3 Topologies"
   [RFC8346].  While working on SIMAP requirements
   [I-D.draft-ietf-nmop-simap-concept] and investigating the OSPF
   topology, some limitations have been discovered in [RFC8345],
   regarding how the topology can be represented.  Those limitations
   (and potential improvements) are covered in
   [I-D.draft-havel-nmop-simap-yang].

   This document explains the scope and purpose of the OSPF topology
   model and how the topology and service models fit together.  The YANG
   data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with OSPF and the
   contents of [RFC8345].  The document uses terms from those documents.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950], [RFC8795] and [RFC8346].

   The terms SIMAP, SIMAP modelling, SIMAP data, topology, multi-layered
   topology and topology layer are specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-nmop-simap-concept].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Tree Diagram

   Authors include a simplified graphical representation of the data
   model specified in Section 4 of this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.4.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

              +========+=======================+===========+
              | Prefix | Yang Module           | Reference |
              +========+=======================+===========+

2.  Use Cases

   Use cases for this document are the same than explained in
   [I-D.draft-ogondio-nmop-isis-topology].  Here are included for
   completeness and discussion.  Future versions may consider removing
   them.

   This information is required in the IP/MPLS planning process to
   properly assess the required network resources to meet the traffic
   demands in normal and failure scenarios.  Network operators perform
   the capacity planning for their networks and run regular what-if
   scenarios analysis based on representations of the real network.
   Those what-if analysis and capacity planning processes require, among
   other information, a topological view (domains, nodes, links, network
   interconnection) of the deployed network.

   The standardization of an abstracted view of the OSPF topology model
   as NorthBound Interface (NBI) of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
   controllers allows the unified query of the OSFP topology in order to
   inject this information into third party tools covering specialized
   cases.

   The OSFP topological model should export enough OSFP information to
   permit these tools to simulate the IP routing.  By mapping the
   traffic demand, ideally at the IP flow level, to the topology, we can
   simulate the traffic growth, evaluating this way its effect on the
   routing and quality of service.  That is, simulating how IP-level
   traffic demands would be forwarded, after OSPF convergence is
   reached, and from there estimating, using appropriate mathematical
   models, related KPIs like the occupation in the links or end-to-end
   latencies.

   In summary, the network-wide view of the OSFP topology enables
   multiple use cases:

   *  Network design: verifying that the actual deployed OSFP network
      conforms to the planned design.

   *  Capacity planning.  Dimensioning or redesign of the IP
      infrastructure to satisfy target KPI metrics under existing or
      forecasted traffic demands.

   *  What-if analysis.  Estimation of the network KPIs in modified
      network situations.  For instance, failure situations, traffic
      anomaly situations, addition or deletion of new adjacencies, IGP
      weight reconfigurations, etc.

   *  Failure analysis.  Systematic and massive test of the network
      under multiple simulated failure situations, evaluating the
      network fault tolerance properties, and using mathematical models
      to derive statistical network availability metrics.

2.1.  Relationship with the OSPF YANG Model

   [RFC9129] specifies a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage the OSPF protocol on network elements.  This data model
   covers the configuration of an OSPF routing protocol instance, as
   well as the retrieval of OSPF operational states.  [RFC9129] is still
   expected to be used for individual network elements configuration and
   monitoring.  On the other hand, the proposed YANG model in this
   document covers the abstracted view of the entire network topology
   containing OSPF.  As such, this model is aimed at being available via
   the NBI of an SDN controller.

2.2.  Relationship with SIMAP

   As described in [I-D.draft-ietf-nmop-simap-concept], SIMAP is the
   data model that provides a view of the operator's network and
   services and specifically provides an approach to model multi-layered
   topology and an appropriate mechanism to navigate amongst layers and
   correlate between them.  SIMAP defines the core topological entities,
   their roles within the network, essential properties, and
   relationships—both within individual layers and across multiple
   layers.  It serves as a foundational topological model that links and
   integrates other models, including those for configuration,
   maintenance, assurance (e.g., KPIs, status, health, symptoms),
   traffic engineering (TE), behavioral modeling, simulation, emulation,
   mathematical abstractions, and AI algorithms.

   Within SIMAP, the IGP topology (in this case, OSPF) is just one of
   the layers of the multi-layered topology, for specific user (the
   network operator in charge of the IGP) for specific IGP use cases as
   described before.  All the use cases and requirements specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-nmop-simap-concept] are also applicable to OSPF
   topology as well.

   [I-D.draft-havel-nmop-simap-yang] specifies what requirements are
   supported by RFC8345, identifies the gaps and proposes the solutions
   for these gaps.  This will have impact on OSPF topology modelling and
   will provide the mechanism to model IGP areas as networks, have
   relation between AS and areas, have bidirectional links, etc.

3.  YANG Data Model for OSPF Topology

   The abstract (base) network data model is defined in the "ietf-
   network" module of [RFC8345].  The OSPF-topology builds on the
   network data model defined in the "ietf-network" module [RFC8345],
   augmenting the nodes with OSPF information, which anchor the links
   and are contained in nodes.

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at
   the node level.  Each parameter and description are detailed
   following:

   *  Network-types: Its presence identifies the OSPF topology type.
      Thus, the network type MUST be ospf-topology.

   *  OSPF timer attributes: Identifies the node timer attributes
      configured in the network element.  They are wait timer, rapid
      delay, slow delay, and the timer type (linear or exponential back-
      off).

   *  OSPF status: contains the neighbours' information.

   The following figure is based on the Figure 1 from [RFC8346], where
   the example-ospf-topology is replaced with ietf-l3-ospf-topology and
   where arrows show how the modules augment each other.

   A second set of parameters, along with augmentations, is included at
   the link and termination point level.  Each parameter is listed as
   follows:

   *  Interface-type

   *  Area ID

   *  Metric

   *  Passive mode

4.  RFC8345 Limitations for the OSPF Modeling

   There are some limitations in the [RFC8345] that are explained in
   more detail in [I-D.draft-havel-nmop-simap-yang].  The current
   version of the ietf-l3-ospf-topology module is based on the current
   version of [RFC8345].

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF {!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-ospf-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   name:         ietf-l3-ospf-topology
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-ospf-topology
   maintained by IANA: N
   prefix:       ietf-l3-ospf-topology
   reference:    RFC XXXX
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

9.  Implementation Status

   This section will be used to track the status of the implementations
   of the model.  It is aimed at being removed if the document becomes
   RFC.
